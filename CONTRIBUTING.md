# Guide to Contributing

## The Team Norms

### Our team is comprised of five students: <br/>

Emily Yang - [xSeaGato](https://github.com/xSeaGato)<br/>
Brad Huang - [kaiserarg](https://github.com/kaiserarg)<br/>
Sophia Domonoske - [swdomo](https://github.com/swdomo)<br/>
Abby Ibarra - [abbyibarra](https://github.com/abbyibarra)<br/>
Yinqi Wang - [Yinqi596](https://github.com/Yinqi596)<br/>

### Communication
We will communicate on Discord on a channel with course admin. If the team decides, we will meet on zoom to discuss sprint tasks and for collaboration. At the beginning of sprints, we will meet over zoom to assign roles to provide adequate time to accomplish tasks.

### Team Values

* Have strong work ethic. This includes communication and understanding that people have other obligations
* If a team member knows they will have a week where they may not be able to commit as much time as other weeks, this should be communicated. However, if this happens every week, then there should be further discussions
* We are a team, so any questions about the project should be asked in the team channel. We are all in the process of learning software and web application development. 
* Resolving conflicts
    * If there are any concerns or conflicts, they should initially be brought up in the team channel. We will attempt to resolve all conflicts as a group before taking larger conflicts to admin.
    * If a teammate is failing to deliver on their part, we will talk with the teammate to ensure we are on the same page in terms of workload.
    * If the teammate simply let their work fall through the cracks, then they will be reminded of their expectations. If they continue to not contribute to the project, we will continue to remind them of their commitments. After several reminders, we will go to admin.
    * If the teammate feels that their schedule does not allow for their work to be completed, we will come to a new agreement of workload expectations

* Sprint Cadence
    * Each sprint will take 2 weeks
* Daily Standups
    * We will meet twice a week for 15 to 30 minutes to ensure that all members are contributing and doing their tasks.
    * Members will join using Zoom
    * Team members should get in the routine of checking Discord at least once a day and respond to any direct messages promptly. However, during the end of sprints, team members should expect to receive more direct messages and should, therefore, are expected to check Discord several times throughout the day.
    * Agreement that members will not cover for other members who do not participate
    * Agreement that a member who makes no progress on a task for two standups or more in a row will be reported to management

### Coding Standards
* Team members will use Visual Studio Code as our code editor
    * Team members will use GitHub to manage the project
    * Team members will NOT use GitHub Desktop
    * Team members will use Tailwind
    * Team members will use snake case for naming variables
    * Don't over-engineer. Write minimum code to get things working end to end, only then iterate to improve. - Code for each task and spike must be peer-reviewed and pass tests before merging into the main branch of code.
    * Always push working code, if you break the pipeline/build then fix it.
    * Make granular and small commits, per feature or per bug fix.
    * Provide descriptive commit messages.
    * Write self documenting code. Use descriptive variable and function names. Avoid unnecessary name shortening.
    * Don't leave dead/commented out code behind. If you see such code, delete it.
    * Write automated tests to cover critical integration points and functionality (once you learn how to do that).

# Git workflow that the team follows
* At the start of each sprint, issues will be added to the Memory Map Task Board and allotted to the proper sprint backlogs. 
* Throughout the sprint, team members will be assigned issues they must complete
* Once a team member starts an issue they will follow the process:
    1. Create a new branch with 
    2. Open a new drafted pull request for that branch
        * A draft will provide an extra layer of precaution so the team member does not accidentally merge the pull request
    3. All of their commit messages will be single line
    4. When the feel that their code is ready, or if they have questions, they will request another team member to review their code
        * To ensure that someone reviews their work, they should message the team discord channel that the pr is ready
    5. Once the pr is approved, it will be merged
* At the end of each sprint, the leftover issues will be put into the project backlog

# Rules of contributing and any considerations or how and what to contribute
* Anyone contributing should take into consideration this is a group project for class, so they should maintain professional correspondence
* They should follow the our convention of using camel case variables and Tailwind for our css language
* If they have a new idea, they should reach out to the team for general approval and concensus
# Instructions for setting up the local development environment in order to work on this project
* If you are one of the five team members, you should clone this repository onto your local computer
* Otherwise, you should fork the repository and clone the forked repository onto your local computer
* You will then need to install the proper npm packages in the front-end and back-end folders.

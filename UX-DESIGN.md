## App Map

![App Map](/ux-design/MemoryMapAppMap.png)

This is our app map which is a very basic overview of our apps functionality and relations between each page on our app. We wanted to users to be able to create memory pins, view their friends memory pins, and have a map that keeps track of all the pins.

## Wire Frame

![Wireframe](/ux-design/MemoryMapWireframe.png)

This is our wireframe based on our App Map, after the login screen, this app essentially functions with 4 different tabs from Map, which is the home page, to Friends to Feeds to Profile.

### Header and Footer

These are our header and footers which show up in every screen (the footer shows up in every screen after login). The header is a simple logo. Footer is a navagational navbar component that allows users to navigate around the different screens.

There is also an option to register
A loading screen will be the intermediary before entering the app
